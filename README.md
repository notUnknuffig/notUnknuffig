- hi, I'm Unknuffig!
- i'm interested in Programming in (almost) all Languages
- i'm currently trying learning Rust (T-T)
- even though you might think i am new to programming i am not (i'm just making a lot of mistakes), i have been programming since a few years.
- don't ask me for help, i don't know either.
- how to reach me? Don't even try it... I probably won't respond anyway.
- pronouns: She/They
- fun fact: I am stupid
